  ## Description

  This is an app for managing passwords. User can create their own password or can choose to randomly generate it.  Passwords are saved to a json file.  Also, when a password is randomly generated, it is automatically saved to the clipboard so that user can simply paste it when signing up for a new website.  The user can then retrieve passwords by searching by website.
